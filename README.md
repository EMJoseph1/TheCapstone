# TheCapstone

I am very proud of this project considering I learned a lot from it. The postives were I was able to have users upload photos, and so they are about to edit the name and 
url link. One of the things I had trouble with was I had to recreate my sql table several times because I was orginally trying to put images directly in the database. 
I soon was told this was a bit out of my reach of skill so instead I put url links in them which ended up being much easier. Some goals of mine that I was not able to reach
were having the user choose which images they wanted for a slideshow, I also was unable to create the actual slideshow and instead just gave the image CRUD functionality.
Something I scratched the surface on was learning bootstrap, knowing if I dedictated more time to it, I could have improved the css to a higher degree.
